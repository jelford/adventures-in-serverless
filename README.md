# adventures in serverless

a collection of artefacts that went into trying out different serverless technologies

* aws-sam: the first one I tried out, because I wanted to use (modern) python, and Google Functions is node-only.
  quite a lot of setup required, fiddly permissions, and error were hard to track down (where are my logs? why
  is this a 500 error via the API gateway when it worked okay in the local testing tool / lambda console?)

* serverless: looking at this framework next.
